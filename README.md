Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters in Kerala, causing significant loss of life, property, and infrastructure damage each year. With the increasing impact of climate change and unpredictable rainfall patterns, accurate flood prediction has become crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. This project focuses on developing a flood prediction system for Kerala by leveraging machine learning techniques. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks, are trained and evaluated using historical and environmental data. The model with the highest accuracy is then used to predict the likelihood of floods and identify areas with high, moderate, and low flood risk, ultimately helping authorities and communities take timely precautionary measures.
